## Career Objectives

Majoring in finance, I am an aspiring financial analyst and a small business owner. In addition to taking finance classes, I am currently taking business analytics courses to earn a double major status.

Outside of college, I love volunteering in my local community. This provides me with an opportunity to give back to those in need, which I find to be a very rewarding experience.

As a leader, problem-solver, and creative thinker at heart, during breaks, I love modifying my car, looking for ways to grow my business, and learning new concepts/skills in various fields.

Currently, I am seeking opportunities that will allow me to implement my financial skills in a fast-paced and dynamic work environment. Specific areas of interest include investment banking, wealth management, and financial analytics.

## Hobbies

Outside of my academic life, I love spending time oudoors. Specifically, modifying cars, biking, rafting, and going on hiking trips.

Additionally, I find it extremely rewarding working as a firefighter in my local township, volunteering as a Peer Health Advisor on campus, as well as working as a treasurer for Lehigh University EMS.
