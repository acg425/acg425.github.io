Assisted in the formation of the North Penn High School (NPHS) Paintball Club. This task involved using the business communication skills I learned at Lehigh University to provide the student reaching out with professional documents and graphical designs. These documents included several strategically thought-out and business-like proposals aimed at persuading the school board to accept the creation of the paintball club.

Additionally, I created the club website, by-laws, liability waivers, graphical designs, and databases for effective and easy club management. My work eventually helped the student in having his club quickly approved with no questions or concerns in mind.

## Career Objectives

Majoring in finance, I am an aspiring financial analyst and a small business owner. In addition to taking finance classes, I am currently taking business analytics courses to earn a double major status.

Outside of college, I love volunteering in my local community. This provides me with an opportunity to give back to those in need, which I find to be a very rewarding experience.

As a leader, problem-solver, and creative thinker at heart, during breaks, I love modifying my car, looking for ways to grow my business, and learning new concepts/skills in various fields.

Currently, I am seeking opportunities that will allow me to implement my financial skills in a fast-paced and dynamic work environment. Specific areas of interest include investment banking, wealth management, and financial analytics.

## Hobbies

Outside of my academic life, I love spending time oudoors. Specifically, modifying cars, biking, rafting, and going on hiking trips.

Additionally, I find it extremely rewarding working as a firefighter in my local township, volunteering as a Peer Health Advisor on campus, as well as working as a treasurer for Lehigh University EMS.
