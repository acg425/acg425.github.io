For this project, we create a predictive model to detect fraud in financial service payments and transfers. Currently, there are many hurdles when it comes to fraud detection; many of the predictors are fallible and don't correctly predict whether a payment is actually fraudelent or not. The goal of this project will be to train several different machine learning models to detect fraud given the attributes: "payment_type", "amount", "nameOrig", "oldBalanceOrig", "namedDest", "isFlaggedFraud", "isFraud", among others.

After developing the machine learning model trained on the financial transaction data, it showed promising results in detecting fraudulent activity. By using techniques such as stratified sampling, data preprocessing, and hyperparameters, we were able to build a Random Forest classifier that achieved high accuracy (0.985) and precision (0.991) scores on the test set. However, the model still struggled with recall (0.8501), indicating that a significant portion of fraudulent transactions were missed. This highlights the inherent challenge of class imbalance in fraud detection, where fraudulent cases are relatively rare compared to legitimate transactions.

We discovered moving forward, further efforts should be made to improve the model's recall performance, potentially through more advanced sampling methods or by incorporating additional relevant features. Additionally, the business implications of false positives versus false negatives should be carefully evaluated to strike the right balance between precision and recall based on the specific requirements of a financial institution. Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in enhancing fraud detection capabilities, while also emphasizing the need for continuous model refinement.

Assisted in the formation of the North Penn High School (NPHS) Paintball Club. This task involved using the business communication skills I learned at Lehigh University to provide the student reaching out with professional documents and graphical designs. These documents included several strategically thought-out and business-like proposals aimed at persuading the school board to accept the creation of the paintball club.

Additionally, I created the club website, by-laws, liability waivers, graphical designs, and databases for effective and easy club management. My work eventually helped the student in having his club quickly approved with no questions or concerns in mind.

## Career Objectives

Majoring in finance, I am an aspiring financial analyst and a small business owner. In addition to taking finance classes, I am currently taking business analytics courses to earn a double major status.

Outside of college, I love volunteering in my local community. This provides me with an opportunity to give back to those in need, which I find to be a very rewarding experience.

As a leader, problem-solver, and creative thinker at heart, during breaks, I love modifying my car, looking for ways to grow my business, and learning new concepts/skills in various fields.

Currently, I am seeking opportunities that will allow me to implement my financial skills in a fast-paced and dynamic work environment. Specific areas of interest include investment banking, wealth management, and financial analytics.

## Hobbies

Outside of my academic life, I love spending time oudoors. Specifically, modifying cars, biking, rafting, and going on hiking trips.

Additionally, I find it extremely rewarding working as a firefighter in my local township, volunteering as a Peer Health Advisor on campus, as well as working as a treasurer for Lehigh University EMS.
